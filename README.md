# DashboardTest

This repository contains a small static web dashboard example and a JSON
configuration file demonstrating a possible runtime format for Unity.

Open `index.html` in a browser to try the interface. You can add models,
create version entries, tweak textures, edit parameters and log build or
export actions directly in the page. The provided `sample-config.json`
shows how model and texture metadata might be structured for consumption by
a Unity application.
